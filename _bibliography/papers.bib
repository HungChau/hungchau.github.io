	abstract={Higher education is a source of skill acquisition for many middle- and high-skilled jobs. But what specific skills do universities impart on students to prepare them for desirable careers? In this study, we analyze a large novel corpora of over one million syllabi from over eight hundred bachelors’ granting US educational institutions to connect material taught in higher education to the detailed work activities in the US economy as reported by the US Department of Labor. First, we show how differences in taught skills both within and between college majors correspond to earnings differences of recent graduates. Further, we use the co-occurrence of taught skills across all of academia to predict the skills that will be taught in a major moving forward. Our unified information system connecting workplace skills to the skills taught during higher education can improve the workforce development of high-skilled workers, inform educational programs of future trends, and enable employers to quantify the skills of potential workers.},

  abstract={The increasing popularity of digital textbooks as a new learning media has resulted in a growing interest in developing a new generation of adaptive textbooks that can help readers to learn better through adapting to the readers’ learning goals and the current state of knowledge. These adaptive textbooks are most frequently powered by internal knowledge models, which associate a list of unique domain knowledge concepts with each section of the textbook. With this kind of concept-level knowledge representation, a number of intelligent operations could be performed, which include student modeling, adaptive navigation support, and content recommendation. However, manual indexing of each textbook section with concepts is challenging, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Modern research in the area of natural language processing offers an attractive alternative, called automatic keyphrase extraction. While a range of keyphrase and concept extraction methods have been developed over the last twenty years, few of the known approaches were applied and evaluated in a textbook context. In this paper, we present FACE, a supervised feature-based machine learning method for automatic concept extractions from digital textbooks. This method has been created for building domain and student models that form the core of intelligent textbooks. We evaluated FACE on a newly constructed full-scale dataset by assessing how well it approximates concept annotations produced by human experts and how well it supports the needs of student modeling. The results show that FACE outperforms several state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction methods.}

abstract={With the increased popularity of electronic textbooks, there is a growing interest in developing a new generation of “intelligent textbooks,” which have the ability to guide readers according to their learning goals and current knowledge. Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge, and the most popular type of integrated knowledge is a list of relevant concepts mentioned in the textbooks. With these concepts, multiple intelligent operations, such as content linking, content recommendation, or student modeling, can be performed. However, existing automatic keyphrase extraction methods, even supervised ones, cannot deliver sufficient accuracy to be practically useful in this task. Manual annotation by experts has been demonstrated to be a preferred approach for producing high-quality labeled data for training supervised models. However, most researchers in the education domain still consider the concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than a carefully executed task, which can result in low-quality annotated data. Using the annotation of concepts for the Introduction to Information Retrieval textbook as a case study, this paper presents a knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations. As demonstrated by the data we collected, the inter-annotator agreement gradually increased along with our procedure, and the concept annotations we produced led to better results in document linking and student modeling tasks. The contributions of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a codebook for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations for the target textbook, which could be used as a gold standard in further intelligent textbook research.},

abstract = {Authoring an adaptive educational system is a complex process that involves allocating a large range of educational content within a fixed sequence of units. In this paper, we describe Content Wizard, a concept-based recommender system for recommending learning materials that meet the instructor's pedagogical goals during the creation of an online programming course. Here, the instructors are asked to provide a set of code examples that jointly reflect the learning goals that are associated with each course unit. The Wizard is built on top of our course-authoring tool, and it helps to decrease the time instructors spend on the task and to maintain the coherence of the sequential structure of the course. It also provides instructors with additional information to identify content that might be not appropriate for the unit they are creating. We conducted an off-line study with data collected from an introductory Java course previously taught at the University of Pittsburgh in order to evaluate both the practicality and effectiveness of the system. We found that the proposed recommendation's performance is relatively close to the teacher's expectation in creating a computer-based adaptive course.},
